[ch [title Introduction]

    My previous article [link url=https://pxml-lang.github.io/docs/articles/suggestion-for-better-xml-html/index.html text="Suggestion For a Better XML/HTML Syntax"] suggests a new XML/HTML syntax called [i practicalXML ([b pXML])]. pXML is less verbose than XML, and has other advantages.

    In this article I introduce a parser for pXML. The parser is written in Java, open-sourced under MIT, and the source code is available on [link url=[!get Github_parser_repo] text=Github]. Examples used in this article are on [link url=[!get Github_example_repo] text=Github] too.

    More information about pXML can be found on its [link url=https://pxml-lang.github.io text=website].
