[ch Empty Element

    An empty XML element is an element that has no attributes and no child nodes.

    A typical example is the [c br] element used to insert a new line in an HTML document. Here is the code:
    [code
        <br />  <!--     XML-compliant -->
        <br>    <!-- not XML-compliant -->
    code]

    In pXML, this is written as:
    [code
        [br]
    code]
]
