[ch [title PDML vs XML/JSON/YAML]

    For a thorough explanation of the rationale behind PDML please read [link url=[u:get pdml_docs_url]suggestion-for-better-xml-html/index.html text="Suggestion For a Better XML/HTML Syntax"].

    That article compares code examples written in XML, JSON, and YAML and demonstrates that PDML is:
    [list
        [el less verbose than XML and JSON, but slightly more verbose than YAML]
        
        [el suitable for markup code, unlike JSON and YAML]
        
        [el suitable for big, complex data structures, unlike YAML]
    ]

    Moreover PDML has a number of unique, practical [i extensions] not found in XML, JSON, or YAML (see next chapter).

    Basic PDML (without extensions) is much easier to parse than XML, JSON, or YAML.
