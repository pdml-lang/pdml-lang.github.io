[ch [title Introduction]

    The [i Practical Data and Markup Language] ([link (url=[u:get pdml_website_url]) PDML]) is a text format to store data and markup code.

    PDML's design goals are:
    [list
        [el human-friendly (easy to read and write for people)]

        [el suitable for:
            [list
                [el data [i and] markup code]
                [el small [i and] big, complex data structures]
            ]
        ]

        [el a core syntax that is succinct and simple, and therefore easy to parse/deserialize and serialize]

        [el unique, powerful extensions]
    ]

    A distinction is made between [i Core PDML] and [i extensions]. [i Core PDML] is the absolute minimum needed to store data. Extensions are optional features to make PDML more practical and powerful.

    This document mainly covers [i Core PDML]. However, chapter [xref (ref_id=extensions)] contains an overview of extensions, and a link to more information.
