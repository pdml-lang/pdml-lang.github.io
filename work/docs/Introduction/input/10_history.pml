[ch [title History of PDML]

    In 2018 I created the [i [link url=https://www.pml-lang.dev text="Practical Markup Language (PML)"]] to solve problems I encountered with existing markup languages (Markdown, Asciidoctor, HTML, Docbook, etc.). In march 2019 I published [link url=https://www.pml-lang.dev/docs/articles/practical-document-markup-language/index.html text="We Need a New Document Markup Language - Here is Why"] to illustrate the existing problems, and to show how they are solved in PML.

    Besides being suitable for [i markup code], the PML syntax could also be used to store [i data]. In March 2021 I therefore published [link url=https://pxml-lang.github.io/docs/articles/suggestion-for-better-xml-html/index.html text="Suggestion For a Better XML/HTML Syntax"] (also published on [link url=https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5296768/Suggestion-for-a-Better-XML-HTML-Syntax text=codeproject]). The new syntax was called [i practicalXML (pXML)], because it was more succinct, but conceptually similar to XML. Moreover, pXML could be converted to XML, and vice versa. All was published and documented at the (now obsolete) [link url=https://pxml-lang.github.io/ text="pXML website"].

    In October 2021 pXML was renamed to PDML. The reason was that pXML needed a lot of improvements (extensions) to make it suitable for PML (e.g. parameterized text, document splitting, raw text sections, etc). At the end, pXML was more than just an alternative syntax for XML. It had plugable and configurable types and extensions, as well as other features not available in XML. Thus the name was changed from [i practicalXML (pXML)] to [i Practical Data and Markup Language (PDML)], and everything was published on a [link url=[u:get pdml_website_url] text="new website"].

    In a nutshell: PDML originated in PML, and was temporarily called pXML.
