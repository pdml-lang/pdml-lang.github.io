[ch (id=utility_nodes) [title Utility Nodes]

    Utility nodes provide various practical features and utilities.

    They are all associated with the predefined namespace prefix [c u] ([b [i u]]tility).

    For example:
    [list
        [el
            A [c u:set] node assigns a text to a named parameter, and subsequent [c u:get] nodes can be used to insert the same text multiple times into the PDML document.
            This supports the important [link (url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) Don't repeat yourself (DRY)] principle.
        ]

        [el
            A [c u:ins_file] node reads a text file and inserts the text into the PDML document.

            [- TODO?
                Here is an example of the main file of an article written in [link (url=TODO) PML]:
                [code
                ]
            -]
        ]
    ]

    The full list of utility nodes is documented in chapter [link (url=[u:get pdml_docs_extensions_url]reference_manual/index.html#utility_nodes ) Utility Nodes] of the reference manual.
