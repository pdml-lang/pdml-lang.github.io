[ch (id=intro) [title Introduction]

    This document shows examples of encoding commonly used data structures and markup using [i only Core PDML].
    [link (url=^[get extensions_url]) PDML extensions] (optional features, not part of Core PDML) will not be used in the examples below, but mentioned occasionally to explain when and why they are useful.

    The aim is to [i show examples] without digging into details â€” this is not a comprehensive Core PDML tutorial.

    [note
        You can consult the exact rules governing Core PDML (and get some practical tips) in the [link (url=^[get core_spec_url]) Core PDML Specification].

        Readers are expected to have a basic knowledge of fundamental data structures.
