[ch (id=tables) [title Tables]

    A table is a collection whose elements are records of the same type.
    
    For example, a table containing three products would look like this:
    [code
        """
        [products
            [product
                [id 1]
                [name Keyboard]
                [price 50.00]
            ]
            [product
                [id 2]
                [name Mouse]
                [price 25.00]
            ]
            [product
                [id 3]
                [name Monitor]
                [price 300.00]
            ]
        ]
        """
    ]
]
