[ch (id=grammar) [title Grammar]

    The grammar is defined in separate documents, in two variations:
    [list
        [el [link (url=[u:get pdml_docs_url]ebnf/index.html) Extended Backus–Naur form (EBNF)]]
        [el [link (url=[u:get pdml_docs_url]railroad/index.html) railroad diagrams]]
    ]

    [note
        This document is the only official specification for [i Core PDML].
        
        The EBNF grammar and the railroad diagrams are just auxiliary assets to help readers better contextualize the specification.
