                        <p class="pml-paragraph">To get an idea of what can be done with PDML, let's have a look at some basic, simple examples.</p>
                        <div class="pml-header">Text Node</div>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Suppose a config file in which parameter <code class="pml-inline-code">color</code> has the value <code class="pml-inline-code">green</code>.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In JSON we would use the following syntax:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>&quot;color&quot; = &quot;green&quot;</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In XML we could use an attribute:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>color = &quot;green&quot;</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">... or an element:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;color&gt;green&lt;/color&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In PDML the syntax is:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>[color green]</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">The above code is called a <i class="pml-italic">node</i> in PDML.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">As we can see, a node is delimited by <code class="pml-inline-code">[]</code> - a pair of square brackets. A node starts with <code class="pml-inline-code">[</code>, and ends with <code class="pml-inline-code">]</code>.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">A node has a <i class="pml-italic">name</i> and an optional <i class="pml-italic">value</i>. In our example, the name is <code class="pml-inline-code">color</code> and the value is <code class="pml-inline-code">green</code>.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">A space character is used to separate the name from the value.</p>
                        <div class="pml-header">Child Node</div>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Besides text, a node's value can also be another node:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>[config [color green]]</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Here, the value of node <code class="pml-inline-code">config</code> is another node with name <code class="pml-inline-code">color</code>, and value <code class="pml-inline-code">green</code>.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">For better readability we can also write:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>[config
    [color green]
]</code></pre>
                        <div class="pml-header">Tree</div>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">The node's value can be a <i class="pml-italic">list</i> of nodes, and each child node can itself have any number of child nodes:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>[config
    [color green]
    [size
        [width 200]
        [height 100]
    ]
]</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Hence, PDML can be used to store simple or complex tree data.</p>
                        <div class="pml-header">Text and Child Nodes Mixed</div>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">A node's value can be a <i class="pml-italic">mixture</i> of any number of text and child notes. This makes PDML convenient to store markup code.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Consider the following HTML code:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>&lt;p&gt;Life is &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; if we are &lt;b&gt;kind&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">... which would be rendered as :</p>
<p>Life is <i>better</i> if we are <b>kind</b>.</p>                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In PDML this is written as:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>[p Life is [i better] if we are [b kind].]</code></pre>
                        <div class="pml-header">Empty Node</div>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">A node can be empty. It has a name, but no value:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>[color]</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In JSON this would be written as:</p>
                        <pre class="pml-code"><code>&quot;color&quot; = null</code></pre>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In XML:</p>

                        <p class="pml-paragraph">or simply:</p>

                        <h2 class="pml-chapter-title">History of PDML</h2>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In 2018 I was a bit frustrated with existing markup languages (Markdown, Asciidoctor, HTML, Docbook, etc.) I used for my <a href="https://www.ppl-lang.dev/blog/index.html" class="pml-link">blog</a>.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">After some &quot;pondering and using a pencil and eraser&quot; sessions, I finally came up with a new markup language which I called <i class="pml-italic">Practical Markup Language (PML)</i>. In march 2019 I published <a href="https://www.pml-lang.dev/docs/articles/practical-document-markup-language/index.html#PML_chapter" class="pml-link">We Need a New Document Markup Language - Here is Why</a>. This article illustrates the problems I encountered with popular markup languages, and shows how they are solved in PML. The article also contained a link to a first implementation, so that people could try out PML and send feedback.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">Later I realized that, besides <i class="pml-italic">markup code</i>, the PML syntax could also be used to store all other kinds of structured and unstructured <i class="pml-italic">data</i>. In March 2021 I published <a href="https://pxml-lang.github.io/docs/articles/suggestion-for-better-xml-html/index.html" class="pml-link">Suggestion For a Better XML/HTML Syntax</a> (also published on <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5296768/Suggestion-for-a-Better-XML-HTML-Syntax" class="pml-link">codeproject</a>). I named my idea <i class="pml-italic">practicalXML (pXML)</i>, because of the conceptual similarities between pXML and XML. Moreover, pXML could be converted to XML, and vice versa. All was published and documented at the (now obsolete) <a href="https://pxml-lang.github.io/" class="pml-link">pXML website</a>.</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In October 2021 I decided to rename pXML to PDML. The reason was that pXML needed a lot of improvements (extensions) to make it suitable for PML (e.g. parameterized text, document splitting, raw text sections, etc). At the end, pXML was more than just an alternative syntax for XML. It had plugable and configurable types and extensions, as well as other features not available in XML. Thus the name was changed from <i class="pml-italic">practicalXML (pXML)</i> to <i class="pml-italic">Practical Data and Markup Language (PDML)</i>, and everything was published on the TODO .</p>
                        <p class="pml-paragraph">In a nutshell: PDML originated in PML, and was temporarily called pXML.</p>
